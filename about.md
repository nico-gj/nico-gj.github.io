I'm Nico, a French-American engineer currently living in Boston and passionate about computational social sciences, political engagement, and digital government. I am committed to the use of analytics and digital platforms to improve public governance and collective decision-making.

I am currently a graduate student in Technology & Policy at the <a href="https://idss.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society</a>.

Previously, I have worked in digital affairs at the <a href="https://idss.mit.edu/" target="_blank">French Ministry of the Environment</a> as an aide to Secretary of State Brune Poirson, and in political campaign analytics for Emmanuel Macron during the French 2017 presidential elections. I also have academic research experience on the use of data science for policy evaluation, political economy, and entrepreneurial finance (<a href="https://cusp.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">NYU Center for Urban Science</a> and <a href="https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia Business School</a>).

My academic background is in Engineering (M.S. from <a href="http://www.mines-paristech.eu/" target="_blank">L'Ecole des Mines de Paris---MINES ParisTech</a>) and Pure Mathematics and Physics ("classe préparatoire" MPSI-MP at the <a href="https://lyc-henri4.scola.ac-paris.fr/" target="_blank">Lycée Henri IV</a> in Paris).
