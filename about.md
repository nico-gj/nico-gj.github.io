<!-- ![Nico](/img/nico.jpg){: .align-right} -->

I'm Nico, a French-American Engineer living in New York and passionate about analytics, economic policy, and political science.

I am committed to the use of data science and advanced analytics techniques to improve public governance. I'm currently a research scientist at NYU Center for Urban Science, mostly on projects in policy evaluation and political economics. I also work part-time at Columbia Business School, on finance and entrepreneurial economics.

I have previously worked Economic and Data consulting, and on political campaigns (in particular on Emmanuel Macron's Analytics team during the 2017 French presidential elections). My academic background is in Engineering (M.S. from [L'Ecole des Mines de Paris – MINES ParisTech](http://www.mines-paristech.eu/)) and Pure Mathematics and Physics ("classe préparatoire" MPSI-MP at the [Lycée Henri IV](https://lyc-henri4.scola.ac-paris.fr/) in Paris).

My full CV is available [here]({{ site.url }}/docs/cv_nicolas_guetta_jeanrenaud.pdf).
