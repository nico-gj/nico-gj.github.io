I'm currently a research scientist at NYU Center for Urban Science, mostly on projects in policy evaluation and political economics. I also work part-time at Columbia Business School, on finance and entrepreneurial economics.

I have a Master's degree in Engineering from l'Ecole des Mines de Paris (MINES ParisTech), and completed my "classe préparatoire" in Pure Mathematics and Physics at the Lycée Henri IV in Paris.

My CV is available [here]({{ site.url }}/docs/cv_nicolas_guetta_jeanrenaud.pdf).
