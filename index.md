**Welcome to my website !**

I'm an engineering graduate student and researcher at the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society. My interests include computational social sciences, political engagement, and digital government. Check out my [blog posts](/posts/) on my most recent work, [ongoing analyses](/analyses/) for social and political dynamics I am tracking, and [click here](/about/) to find out more about me.

Thanks for visiting,
