Trailing in the polls, disregarded by the vast majority of data and opinion experts, Donald Trump defied all odds last November and snatched the highest office in the country. Despite an amateur-looking campaign and a non-stop flow of scandals and gruesome remarks, his victory is - in terms of electoral college - wide and indisputable.
While it may take years to understand how this political earthquake happened, a close observation of state-by-state results can provide preliminary insight into how Mr. Trump sealed the deal, and left pundits and pollsters scrambling with their predictions.

Using a Principal Component Analysis, we dispersed all 50 American states according to socio-economic and demographic variables such as age and ethnicity, wealth, employment, education, and health (the later inspired by an [excellent piece of data-journalism in The Economist](https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21710265-local-health-outcomes-predict-trumpward-swings-illness-indicator)). The first striking result is how relevant these variables are in clustering states by vote. The first PCA axis especially, which can be interpreted as the "Education-Earnings" axis, clearly splits states along party lines: Clinton and the Democratic Party lead in educated states with important levels of high-earners, while Trump runs the table in states with high unemployment and poverty rates. PCA Axis 2, which distinguishes younger states to older ones, is less explicative on the vote outcome – indicating that age might not be a relevant criteria in predicting vote. [Exit polls reported by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html)
show that although age groups still vote differently, the split isn't as stark as in the previous election.

The American electoral college system makes an analysis of all 50 states of limited relevance, and it certainly does not reflect how campaigns are run and which populations are most courted by the candidates. We therefore restricted the analysis to 13 swing states, widely considered as the most competitive states and subject to the most polling in the run-up to the elections. Again, socio-economic and demographic structure is similar to voting structure. New Hampshire, Virginia, and Colorado,  among the wealthy and educated swing states, systematically lean democrat. With the notable exception of Nevada, swing states with high unemployment and poverty rates and a diverse population, like Arizona and Georgia, are Republican safe-holds. Finally, the older and highly unemployed states of the Rust Belt, as well as Florida, are the ones that really swung the election. These are all states that Obama carried in 2008 and 2012.
