In March, as COVID-19 was undergoing its first uncontrolled spread throughout several US states, President Donald Trump began referring to the disease as the "Chinese Virus". His tweet garnered thousands of comments and shares, and over 150,000 likes. It also triggered scores of political reactions, anti-Asian discrimination, and thousands of subsequent social media posts on the topic.

In this post, we use Natural Language Processing to analyze the discourse around the term "Chinese Virus" on Twitter. We find that the conversation around the virus was largely generated by President Trumpâ€™s use of the term, and that geographic variations in those supporting or criticizing the term largely follow partisan political lines. These results demonstrate that political actors have a very strong influence on how their followers use language.

### One Tweet can go a long way

Donald Trump first used "Chinese Virus" on Twitter on March 16th, claiming that COVID-19 ["comes from China"](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/politics/china-virus.html) when pressed on the issue. A widespread debate ensued, with many health experts cautioning against the use of the term because of the stigma it might cause and Democratic politicians decrying it as racist. In the subsequent months, however, expressions such as "Chinese Virus", ["Wuhan Virus"](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/mike-pompeo-g7-coronavirus-149425), and even ["Kung Flu"](https://twitter.com/bennyjohnson/status/1274503526815870976?s=20) have become commonplace in Trump Administration communications, among right-wing commentators, and on social media. Anti-Asian harassment and violence linked to the COVID-19 pandemic has become a global issue, with most attacks placing blame on Asians for causing the virus or spreading it to others. In the US, the Stop AAPI Hate organization recorded [over 2,500 incidents of anti-Asian violence from March 19th through August 5th](http://www.asianpacificpolicyandplanningcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/STOP_AAPI_Hate_National_Report_3.19-8.5.2020.pdf). Inflammatory language that blames Chinese people for the pandemic undoubtedly fueled this violence.

For the purpose of this project, we collect all the tweets related to the term "Chinese Virus" from January 1st, 2020 to April 30th, 2020. Overall, 14,984 tweets are included in our analysis. Initial time-series plots show that while the term was already in use within small circles before Donald Trumpâ€™s tweet, its use went through the roof in the days following the presidentâ€™s post.

Since we restrict our analysis to Tweets with a geotagged location, we are able to precisely pinpoint where users were located when they reacted to the presidentâ€™s tweet. The county-level map below shows that reaction and subsequent use of the term "Chinese Virus" took place across the entire country.

As could be expected, much of the social media activity was concentrated in dense urban areas such as Miami, Los Angeles, Houston, and New York. In fact, at state level, prevalence of the topic is mostly proportional to population. Largely, the term "Chinese Virus" was on the mind of social media users everywhere, and the use of the term on social media is surprisingly independent of the political leanings of the states the users posted from. One notable exception is the District of Columbia---where the topic was remarkably salient within a small population likely due to the concentration of news media and political users.

<center>
{% include projects/2020-chinese-virus/pop_tweets.html %}
</center>
<br>

Opinions expressed, however, were radically polarized. Some users rushed to denounce the term "Chinese Virus" as racist. For others, its unapologetic use by national elites normalized the term, which became an acceptable synonym to "COVID-19". Finally, in specific far-right circles, this tweet fuels dozens of conspiracies on the inception and spread of the virus.

### NLP Analysis highlights polarized reactions

Understanding the nature of the reaction therefore requires classifying the tweets based on the point of view they express. Advanced methods of Natural Language Processing can create representations of social media posts which account for their semantic meaningâ€”including the topic, opinion, and sentiment expressed by the user. Here, we use [a state-of-the-art transformer language model called BERT](https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270) to create embeddingsâ€” easy-to-compare representations of the meanings and sentiments â€” of every tweet. While traditional language models rely on word occurrence, these representations account for syntax and structure, and unsupervised classification on these embeddings can create relevant opinion clusters.

Since our classification method is unsupervised, we approximate the meaning of every cluster by printing the 5 tweets most central to that cluster. When clusters are relevantly defined, these tweets will have similar semantic meaning. This subset of tweets informs on the opinions and sentiment of the other tweets in that cluster.

<!-- An initial 2-cluster classification produces hardly relevant results. A first cluster references short, non-informative tweets. The second cluster presents more interesting tweets, but combines positive and negative reactions to Trump's use of the term. A finer analysis is therefore necessary. -->

An initial, 3-cluster classification of the already produces relevant splits in the data. Cluster 2 is made up of mostly short, uninformative tweets using "Chinese Virus". However, clusters 1 and 3 distinguish content denouncing the use of the term (Cluster 3) from content supporting its use (Cluster 1).

<!-- When we classify the tweets according to 3 clusters, the cluster of informative tweets remains, mostly unchanged (below, Cluster 2). However, longer, informative tweets have been separated between tweets that are mostly supportive of Trump's use of the term "Chinese Virus" (Cluster 1), and tweets that are critical (Cluster 3). This rudimentary 3-cluster classification already seems to produce relevant clusters for analysis. -->

As we increase the number of clusters, additional nuances start to appear. For 7 classes, the uninformative cluster remains, but the positive and negative clusters have been split into more granular categories. We can manually assign the 7 clusters to 5 categories as described below.

Clusters    | Manual Interpretation                      | Number of Tweets
----------  | ------------------------------------------ |--------------------
1 and 5     | Affirmative use of "Chinese Virus"         | 4,677 tweets
2           | Anger at the use of "Chinese Virus"        | 1,396 tweets
3 and 6     | Critical use of "Chinese Virus"            | 4,757 tweets
4           | Short, uninformative tweets                | 1,724 tweets
7           | Hashtags, normalized use of "Chinese Virus"| 2,430 tweets


This aggregate analysis glosses over important temporal dynamics. The initial surge in "Chinese Virus"-related content, in immediate reaction to Donald Trumpâ€™s infamous tweet, was mostly condemning the president's rhetoric as racist (â€˜Critical use of "Chinese Virus"â€™), or expressing surprise and disbelief (â€˜Short, uninformative tweetsâ€™).

<center>
<img class="example-image" src="/img/2020_chinese_virus/topic_time_series.png" alt="pca" />
</center>
<br>

The overall number of topical tweets quickly decreased and within 2 weeks of Trumpâ€™s first use of the term, making it hard to distinguish which clusters dominate the Twittersphere subsequently. However, examining the share of clusters instead of overall numbers sheds lights on important dynamics taking place. While denunciation of the term as racist, and anger at its use, gradually tapers off, positive use of the term persists in certain circles. By the end of April, 60% of tweets on the topic of "Chinese Virus" use the term in an affirmative way.

</center>
<br>

### Reactions are largely location-specific

Cluster prevalence is also highly location-specific and at the state level, the share of posts pertaining to each cluster varies importantly. Among the states with the largest populations, New York and California exhibit higher levels of content critical of Donald Trumpâ€™s rhetoric, whereas users in Florida and Texas are more likely to support the use of the term.

</center>

Similar analysis can be conducted in historically polarized states. In traditionally Republican statesâ€”such as Alabama, Kentucky, and Oklahomaâ€”Trumpâ€™s rhetoric resonates with voters: the term, quasi-inexistent in social media before its use by the President of the United States, is normalized or even encouraged by users. In traditionally Democratic states, on the other hand, the reaction is strong opposition to the use of the term. The District of Columbia, Massachusetts, and Washington have among the highest scores in the country on the â€˜Critical use of "Chinese Virus"â€™ cluster.

</center>

What can this tell us about Tuesdayâ€™s election? Trumpâ€™s rhetoric seems to polarize along party lines. The states where criticism is the fiercest were going for Biden regardless, and the states that support it most were already acquired to his cause. Cluster distribution in swing states, however, can shed light on the public reaction he faced in the places that matter most for the election.

North Carolina, for instance, offers a muted response: the state scores high on short, uninformative tweets, as well as tweets made up mostly of hashtags. Clusters of support and opposition to Trumpâ€™s rhetoric are both underrepresented in the state. Florida, a must-win state for Trump, has the highest level of affirmative "Chinese Virus" content among swing statesâ€”although nowhere near to the scores we saw in Kentucky and Alabama. On the other hand, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan all present high scores in the anti-"Chinese Virus" cluster.

<center>
<img class="example-image" src="/img/2020_chinese_virus/spider_plot_swing.png" alt="pca" />
</center>

We construct an 'Opposition score to the use of "Chinese Virus"' by scaling the ratio of the cluster 'Critical use of "Chinese Virus"' and 'Affirmative use of "Chinese Virus"'. Only states with over 100 Tweets are included in the visualization. While we don't expect this map to look exactly like Tuesday's electoral map, it does show that Trump's path to victory is a complicated one given the opposition to his rhetoric we observe in several key areas.

<center>
{% include projects/2020-chinese-virus/map_scores.html %}
</center>
<br>

Pundits have long argued that Trumpâ€™s electoral strength lay in his unhinged and provocative speaking style. However, for many voters COVID-19 might have highlighted his limitations as a leader in a time of crisisâ€”both in his management and communication. While the "Chinese Virus" term has clearly stuck within far-right groups, it does not seem to resonate with social media users in crucial swing states. If Trump does end up losing on Tuesday, his divisive and inflammatory rhetoric may very well have contributed to his unmaking.

## Appendix

The code that we use for this project can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/lbyiuou0329/MIT-NLP-project). The following sections walk through the data and methods we use. If you notice any bugs, or are interested in conducting other analyses on this data, please do reach out!

### Data

Our analysis is conducted on a subset of the initial Twitter data accounting for all English-language tweets sent in the United States over the 4-month period (January 1st, 2020 to April 30st, 2020). We also choose to disregard "replies", focusing instead on original posts.

We conduct two stages of cleaning on the tweet text: one preliminary step to prepare the content for BERT representation, and one more extensive step to retain only important keywords for topic classification. The initial cleaning transforms all entries to lower-case and removes website links using Regular Expressions (RegEx). We also replace some standard abbreviations (special characters such as & or contractions such as â€˜rnâ€™ for â€˜right nowâ€™) by textual expressions. This way, the text retains its entire semantic meaning, and can be properly encoded using the BERT transformer. However, much of the semantic language is useless for topic assignment, and the second step of cleaning removes all non-alphanumeric characters, as well as English stop-words and one-letter words. The remaining tokens are stemmed using the `nltk` Snowball Stemmer.

Subsetting to the topic of interest ("Chinese Virus") is done using string matching on a list of keywords. Here, we use the terms "Chinese Virus", "China Virus", "Chinese Coronavirus", and "China Coronavirus", as well as hashtag versions of the terms. Over the 4-month period, we identify 14,984 topical tweets.

### Methods

After subsetting on the tweets of interest, we embed them into a vector space using [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805). BERT or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers uses a transformer architecture to embed sequences of arbitrary length word by word. We use the BERT implementation fine-tuned on the task of encoding the semantic meaning of a sentence found in [Reimers, et al.'s Sentence-BERT (or S-BERT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084), and implemented in the [opensource framework `sentence-transformers`](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers). This Python package creates sentence embeddings using the average of the individual word embeddings in the sentence and trains the base BERT model on a corpus of labeled sentence interpretation data.. Specifically, it is trained as a "siamese network" encoding two sentences simultaneously to identify how similar the sentences are. We simply use one side of this network to embed each sentence individually based on its semantic meaning.

</center>

<br>

Since S-BERT tweet embeddings are high-dimensional (1024 dimensions in the case of the pretrained model we use), we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. We retain the first 100 dimensions of the PCA, which account for over 80% of the data variance.

<center>
<img class="example-image" src="/img/2020_chinese_virus/pca_explan.png" alt="pca" />
</center>

BERT sentence embeddings are clustered using the k-means algorithm. k-means initializes a set number of centroids randomly and uses Lloydâ€™s Algorithm to update their locations so that the distance from every point to its nearest centroid is minimized. We rely on the `scikit-learn` implementation of both of these clustering methods. Since k-means is wholly dependent on the value of k, we test for different values and manually select the most relevant clustering. An alternative is to use Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), which automatically tests different values of k and allows for more general cluster shapes. Overall, however, we did not notice a significant improvement in the quality of the results when using GMM.

The final step of our analysis is to generate a summary of every cluster based on its content. We assume each clusterâ€™s centroid can be interpreted as that clusterâ€™s "typical" tweet: in the absence of a BERT decoding mechanismâ€”which would provide text associated to given coordinatesâ€”we use the 5 nearest tweets to a clusterâ€™s centroid are an approximation of that clusterâ€™s semantic meaning.
