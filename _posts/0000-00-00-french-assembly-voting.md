This project visualizes voting topology in the current French Assemblée Nationale. Individuals who appear closest together on the graph consistently side together on public votes. The further individuals are to one another on the graph, the more they differ in their voting profiles. The position of each member of parliament is therefore informative only relative to where the other individuals are placed. The visualization can be used to identify ideological clusters and to evaluate party polarization.
